#FloatingActionMenu
---
This is a fork from https://github.com/TristanWiley/FloatingActionMenu, I modified it to support both  circle and line menu.
The sample shows how to use it.

Check the example for usage, the default is a line. A "circle" can be used by doing

    menu.setIsCircle(true)
  
  
## Example

The original code is from douo in this gist- gist.github.com/douo/dfde289778a9b3b6918f

I modified the code so it looks better, there's spacing between the buttons.
