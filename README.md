This is a fork from https://github.com/TristanWiley/FloatingActionMenu, I modified it to support both  circle and line menu.
The sample shows how to use it.

#ORIGIN README

## FloatingActionMenu
I got the original code from douo here - gist.github.com/douo/dfde289778a9b3b6918f

I modified the code so it looks better, there's spacing between the buttons.  See the example on how to use it.

## How to Use

1. Like any other library, put this in your Android project and add it as a dependency.
2. You can also use jitpack.io if you want to use Maven.
