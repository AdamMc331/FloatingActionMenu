# FloatingActionMenu
I got the original code from douo here - gist.github.com/douo/dfde289778a9b3b6918f

I modified the code so it looks better, there's spacing between the buttons.  See the example on how to use it.

# How to Use

1. Basically all you need is the FloatingActionMenu and the rounded_corners.xml.
2. Put the rounded_corners.xml in your drawable folder.
3. Then all you have to do is put your class in and do what is shown in the example.
